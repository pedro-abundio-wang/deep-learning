    "# Named Entity Recognition with PyTorch\n",

    "Note : all scripts must be run in `pytorch/nlp`.\n",

    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sentence, give a tag to each word ([Named Entity Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "John   lives in New   York\n",

    "We provide a small subset of the kaggle dataset (30 sentences) for testing in `data/small` but you are encouraged to download the original version on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus/data) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download the dataset** `ner_dataset.csv` on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus/data) and save it under the `nlp/data/kaggle` directory. Make sure you download the simple version `ner_dataset.csv` and NOT the full version `ner.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build the dataset** Run the following script\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python build_kaggle_dataset.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It will extract the sentences and labels from the dataset, split it into train/val/test and save it in a convenient format for our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Debug_ If you get some errors, check that you downloaded the right file and saved it in the right directory. If you have issues with encoding, try running the script with python 2.7.\n",

    "3. In the next section, change `data/small` by `data/kaggle`\n",

    "\n",
    "- loading the hyperparameters for the experiment (the `params.json`)\n",
    "- loading the training and validation data\n",
    "- creating the model, loss_fn and metrics\n",
    "- training the model for a given number of epochs by calling `train_and_evaluate(...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then go through `model/data_loader.py` to understand the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- loading the vocabularies from the `words.txt` and `tags.txt` files\n",
    "- creating the sentences/labels datasets from the text files\n",
    "- how the vocabulary is used to map tokens to their indices\n",
    "- how the `data_iterator` creates a batch of data and labels and pads sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get the high-level idea, depending on your dataset, you might want to modify\n",
    "\n",
    "- `model/model.py` to change the neural network, loss function and metrics\n",
    "- `model/data_loader.py` to suit the data loader to your specific needs\n",
    "- `train.py` for changing the optimizer\n",
    "- `train.py` and `evaluate.py` for some changes in the model or input require changes here\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get something working for your dataset, feel free to edit any part of the code to suit your own needs.\n",
