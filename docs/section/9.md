# Final Report

Here are some of the big topics that students sometime miss.

  * Dataset
    * Type of data and source
    * Description and statistics
    * Train/test split
  * Tuning and Search
    * Architectures
    * Hyperparameters
  * Baseline and Evaluation
    * Metrics
    * State of the art
    * Presentation of results

Don't forget to **explain the choices** you make in all sections and if you tried something write about it!
